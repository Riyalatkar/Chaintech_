# Web Form Project

This is a basic web application built using Flask, a Python web framework. The application includes a web page with a form for collecting user data and incorporates data persistence by storing form submissions in a file.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and Flask installed on your machine. If not, you can install Flask using the following command:

```bash
pip install Flask

```
### Usage

The main web page (/) contains a form for collecting user data (name and email).
Submitted form data is stored in the data_store.txt file.
Navigate to /view_submissions to see a list of all submitted form data.
